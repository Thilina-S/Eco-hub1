We made EcoBin to solve mismanaged waste and to challenge sustainability. Our service makes it easy to schedule garbage collection, avoid missed pickups and have a cleaner neighbourhood.
But we didn’t end it there—we also came up with a buying/selling feature for recurring waste to be introduced and for recycling and responsible consumption to be the new normal.
By providing an easier way of disposing of waste, and a market for recyclables, EcoBin makes it easy for users to help restore our world to its natural state. 
No more missing pickups or wasting money just an easier, smarter way to manage waste!
